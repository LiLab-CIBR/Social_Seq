# Welcome to the Social-Seq Project

These are some explanatory documents for the Social-Seq project. Social-seq is used to analyze the 3D poses, social categories, and emotional states behind social interactions of animals in close contact. By constructing a real-time behavior classification system, it is potentially useful for treating autism (ASD) social disorders.
